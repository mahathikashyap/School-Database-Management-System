# 🏫 School Database Management System

This project was developed as part of a final-year mini project under VTU, focused on managing **student, teacher, and employee data** in a school system. It was implemented using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** for backend database management.

> ⚠️ The original source code was lost due to system issues. This repository is maintained to document the structure, concept, and process of the project for reference and academic demonstration.

## 🔮 Reflection

This project gave us hands-on experience in using SQL with Java, designing relational databases, and developing a simple but structured user interface. It served as a practical foundation for understanding database-driven application development in a school context.
